# Simple ffmpeg scripts

Use [Platypus](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus) to create small macOS
applications to 1) concatenate videos, or 2) merge audio and video tracks
into one file. Practically no error checking to be expected!

## Installation

After installing [ffmpeg](https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/), use
[Platypus](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus) to create applications.

See [this link](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shell-script-mac-apps) on how to set
an icon if you have trouble using Platypus' icon selector.

Don't hesitate to use `Text window` as the output interface, and `Remain running
after execution` to see any possible errors in your scripts.
